# FixCity

**AI-Powered Civic Issue Detection & Resolution Platform**

FixCity is an AI-driven civic infrastructure platform that transforms unstructured citizen complaints into actionable, department-ready municipal tickets using multimodal AI, geospatial intelligence, and real-time dashboards. 

---

## Problem

Urban authorities receive thousands of unstructured civic complaints daily (potholes, garbage, drainage leaks, broken streetlights). Manual review leads to slow response times, safety risks, and inefficient prioritization. 

---

## Solution

FixCity converts citizen reports into structured, prioritized municipal action tickets using AI-powered image and text analysis, automated routing, and severity-aware spatial mapping. 

---

## Key Features

* AI-based multimodal analysis to detect issue type, severity, urgency, and confidence
* Photo-based hazard reporting with automatic GPS tagging
* Automatic generation of department-ready service tickets
* Interactive severity-coded map for rapid decision-making
* Admin dashboard with search, filtering, and status tracking
* XP-based incentive system to encourage citizen participation
* Multilingual interface for inclusive reporting 

---

## Tools

* **Flutter** – Builds the mobile and web user interfaces for citizens and administrators
* **Firebase (Cloud Firestore + Core)** – Real-time backend for storing reports, images, locations, and status updates
* **Gemini AI (2.5 Flash)** – Performs image-based hazard classification and severity assessment
* **Firebase Cloud Functions** – Handles backend orchestration between AI models and the database
* **OpenStreetMaps** – Provides the base map for spatial visualization of reported issues

## SDG Alignment

* **SDG 11:** Improves safety and sustainability of cities through faster issue resolution
* **SDG 9:** Enables smarter infrastructure management using AI
* **SDG 16:** Enhances transparency and efficiency in public service delivery 

---

## Future Scope

* Predictive infrastructure failure detection using historical issue patterns
* Dynamic severity adjustment using real-time traffic and contextual risk signals
